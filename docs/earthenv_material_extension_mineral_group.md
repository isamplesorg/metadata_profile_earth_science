# **Concept scheme:** iSamples Mineral Group Vocabulary 

Vocabulary last modified:  2022-08-27

subtitle: 
  Vocabulary to extend the mineral material type category with the top level mineral group categories. Uses the Nickelâ€“Strunz mineral classes, which divide minerals into ten classes according to chemical composition and crystal structure. Nickel-Strunz group 10 is not included because that material would be mat:organiccompounds. Version 10 of the classification is modified from v 9 (Strunz and Nickel,2002) by Jim Ferraiolo and others, and now extended and maintained by mindat.org. Some scope notes from linked.data.gov.au.

**Concepts**

[]{#mineral}

##  mineral


- Concept URI token: mineral


[]{#boratemineral}

###  Mineral-Borate


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Minerals which contain a borate anion group.

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 06

- Concept URI token: boratemineral


[]{#carbonatenitratemineral}

###  Mineral-Carbonate or Nitrate


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Carbonate minerals are those minerals containing the carbonate ion

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 05

- Concept URI token: carbonatenitratemineral


[]{#halidemineral}

###  Mineral-Halide


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Minerals with a dominant halide anion.

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 03

- Concept URI token: halidemineral


[]{#nativeelementmineral}

###  Mineral-Native Element


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Elements that occur in nature in uncombined form with a distinct
mineral structure. Includes metals and intermetallic alloys;
metalloids and nonmetals; carbides, silicides, nitrides, phosphides

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 01

- Concept URI token: nativeelementmineral


[]{#organicmineral}

###  Mineral-Organic Compound


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Salts of organic acids, hydrocarbons, and miscellaneous organic
minerals formed as a result of geological processes. Includes
hydrocarbons, formates, acetates, oxalates, benzine salts, cyanates.
Chemical compounds in which one or more atoms of carbon are covalently
linked to atoms of other elements, most commonly hydrogen, oxygen, or
nitrogen (https://www.britannica.com/science/organic-compound).

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 10, 
Organic mineral, 

- Concept URI token: organicmineral


[]{#oxidemineral}

###  Mineral-Oxide


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Includes class oxides, hydroxides, and arsenties. Oxides are
minerals in which the oxide anion is bonded to one or more metal
alloys. The hydroxide-bearing minerals are typically included in the
oxide class. Arsenite minerals are very rare oxygen-bearing arsenic
minerals.

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 04

- Concept URI token: oxidemineral


[]{#phosphatearsenatevanadatemineral}

###  Mineral-Phosphate, Arsenate, or Vanadate


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Phosphate minerals contain the phosphate anion along sometimes with
arsenate and vanadate substitutions, and chloride, fluoride, and
hydroxide anions that also fit into the crystal structure. Arsenate
minerals usually refer to the naturally occurring orthoarsenates.

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 08

- Concept URI token: phosphatearsenatevanadatemineral


[]{#silicategermanatemineral}

###  Mineral-Silicate or Germanate


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Rock-forming minerals made up of silicate groups

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 09

- Concept URI token: silicategermanatemineral


[]{#sulfateselenatetelluratemineral}

###  Mineral-Sulfate, Selenate, or Tellurate


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- class of minerals that include the sulfate ion within their
structure.

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 07

- Concept URI token: sulfateselenatetelluratemineral


[]{#sulfidesulfosaltmineral}

###  Mineral-Sulfide or Sulfosalt


- Child of:
 [`mineral`](#mineral)

- Sulfide minerals are a class of minerals containing sulfide or
disulfide as the major anion. Sulfosalt minerals are those complex
sulfide minerals with the general formula: AmBnSp; where A represents
a metal such as copper, lead, silver, iron, and rarely mercury, zinc,
vanadium; B usually represents semi-metal such as arsenic, antimony,
bismuth, and rarely germanium, or metals like tin and rarely vanadium;
and S is sulfur or rarely selenium or/and tellurium (m, n, and p are
integer formula subscripts). Includes sulfides, selenides, tellurides;
arsenides, antimonides, bismuthides; sulfarsenites, sulfantimonites,
sulfbismuthites

- **Alternate labels:**
Nickel-Strunz class 02

- Concept URI token: sulfidesulfosaltmineral
