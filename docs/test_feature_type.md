**Concepts**

[]{#anysampledfeature}

##  Any sampled feature


- Any thing that can be sampled. Top concept in sampled feature type
vocabulary.
- Concept URI token: anysampledfeature


[]{#anthropogenicenvironment}

###  Anthropogenic environment


- Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)

- Sampled feature is produced by or related to human activity past or
present.
- Concept URI token: anthropogenicenvironment


[]{#activehumanoccupationsite}

####  Active human occupation site


- Child of:
 [`anthropogenicenvironment`](#anthropogenicenvironment)

- Specimen samples materials or objects produced by current or ongoing
human activity
- Concept URI token: activehumanoccupationsite


[]{#experimentsetting}

#####  Experiment setting


- Child of:
 [`activehumanoccupationsite`](#activehumanoccupationsite)

- Sampled feature is the experimental set up that produced the sample.
- Concept URI token: experimentsetting


[]{#laboratorycuratorialenvironment}

#####  Laboratory or curatorial environment


- Child of:
 [`activehumanoccupationsite`](#activehumanoccupationsite)

- Specimen samples environment in a laboratory; e.g. lab blank
measurements.
- Concept URI token: laboratorycuratorialenvironment


[]{#pasthumanoccupationsite}

####  Site of past human activities


- Child of:
 [`anthropogenicenvironment`](#anthropogenicenvironment)

- specimen samples a place where humans have been and left evidence of
their activity. Includes prehistoric and paleo hominid sites

[]{#biologicalentity}

###  Biological entity


- Child of:
